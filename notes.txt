Currently assume a 2-player game in the general election mode

Action space:
Approach 1 (58):
    - States (51)
    - National groups (6)
    - End turn (1)
Approach 2 (628):
    - Value per state (51*11=561)
    - Value per national group (6*11=66)
    - End turn (1)

Reward:
- 1 or zero at the end of the game if win or lose
- Number of electoral votes

State space (we can also use same principle as for action space here):
- Current board setup:
    * For each player:
        + Number of investments per state (51)
        + Number of investments per national group (6)
        + Budget at start of round (1)
        + If state is open for this candidate (1)
        + If national group is open for this candidate (1)

- Moves made in this round:
    * Number of investments per state (51)
    * Number of investments per national group (6)
    * Budget at start of move (1) -- might not be necessary

Future improvements:
- Extend two player to multi-player
- Add primaries mode
- Implement fields ui
- Implement gui
